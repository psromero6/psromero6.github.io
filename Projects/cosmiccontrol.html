      <p>My Role in this project was general Development and implementaion of new technologies. I integrated it to the Google Play Store with leaderboards, statistics, ads, and purchasing. I worked on nearly all of the game logic. I also had a hand in the design of the game near the end of the project.</p>
      <p>This was the first professional title that I worked on. I have been working at a senior level, managing code reviews, source control, and releases while activly developing new features, and polishing existing ones, while we move from closed to open beta.</p>
